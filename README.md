#Block Chain Microcosm 

Blockchains are data structures where blocks are inseparably connected. 
What makes blockchains so special is the security level they offer due to the way they are constructed.
Blockchains are unhackable, so it makes perfect sense why cryptocurrency makes use of this technology.
In this project, we tried ourselves at making a microcosm where virtual miners earn cryptocurrency and 
exchange messages and transactions using blockchain. 

Note:
BlockChainBuilder.java class includes all the methods for constructing the blockchain.
Moreover, it also have lots of comprehensive validation checks which ensure that the
integrity and security of the blockchain is maintained at every stage during the building
of the blockchain. Every Message which is a part of the block contains a unique ID.
All of this has been beautifully blended together in the code. 

The word document contains all the outputs of our code and also contains a UML 
Diagram.
